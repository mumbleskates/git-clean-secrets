In this repo we have some accidentally included secret token that we have to completely purge from the history.

Command to run to clean the tree in a single commit (in bash):

for file in $(grep -rl "$secret" .); do sed -i "s/$secret/${secret//?/x}/g" $file ; done
              ^ list offending files    ^ replace the secret with all 'x's

Thus, the full commands might be:

export secret='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'for file in $(grep -rl "$secret" .); do sed -i "s/$secret/${secret//?/x}/g" $file ; done' HEAD

Try it yourself!
